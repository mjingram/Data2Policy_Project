# Data2Policy_Project
Predicting the proportion of people in poverty in Denver using machine learning techniques for the Data 2 Policy Project
This was an event through the Auraria Campus where projects looked into housing and crime datasets to help lawmakers make future laws in Denver.
The Data set I used in this project contained 50 demographics from 2014 housing data and crime incidents per nieghborhood summed from police data. The Csv file is uploaded to this repository. 
Note: The Csv is not cleaned. Many Transformation were done in R. See the R Markdown Doc.
